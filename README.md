## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

1. **Node.js and npm:** Cypress is based on Node.js. Download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Git:** Git is used for version control. Download and install Git from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. **Code Editor:** Choose a code editor of your preference, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

4. **Cypress ( v"^13.6.2") Project Configuration:** Run the following command to install Cypress as a development dependency:

    ```bash
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

    Configure scripts in your `package.json` file to facilitate test execution.

5. **Cypress Dashboard Configuration (Optional):** If you are using the Cypress Dashboard, set up your account on [Cypress Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/) and provide the project key when running tests.

Make sure to check the project-specific documentation for any additional requirements or specific configurations.

## How to Run Tests

Follow the steps below to execute tests in the project:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run Tests Locally:** To run tests locally, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    This command will use Cypress to run tests in command-line mode.

3. **Run Tests with Graphical Interface:** If you prefer an interactive approach, you can open the Cypress graphical interface with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:open
    ```

4. **Run Tests in Mobile Environment (Optional):** If you want to test in a mobile environment, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:open:mobile
    ```

    This command will open the Cypress graphical interface with configuration to emulate a mobile device.
